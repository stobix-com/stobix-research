# üîç Stobix Research

**Stobix Research** is an open dataset and analytics repository by Stobix Labs, focused on crypto market structure and systematic yield products.

This repo contains versioned data collected from public sources, formatted for reproducibility, inspection, and integration. It's a workbench for researchers, developers, and anyone building on-chain finance.

## Overview

All data is stored as raw JSON, versioned by timestamp, and collected automatically.

## Motivation

Most DeFi data pipelines are product-bound or front-end locked. This project takes a lower-level approach: open files, clean structure, zero friction.

Whether you're building a backend, backtesting a strategy, or publishing research, this data should be easy to use and hard to dispute.

## Roadmap

We're starting with centralized structured yield (Binance, OKX), and plan to expand into:

- On-chain vaults and staking pools
- Execution latency benchmarks
- Block-by-block funding spreads
- Real-time token-specific yield curves

Everything in this repo is designed to support advanced modeling and real-world strategy design.
